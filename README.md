# GOBLOG
This is a simple **golang** blog application. That has authentication system.
Part of the challenge of creating same application with same features in **laravel**, **ruby on rails**, **django**, **dotnet core**, **spring**, **golang** and **nodejs**. In the beginning we'll be using go's built in features as much as possible to better understand what go has to offer for web development out of the box.

## Features
* TODO: Authentication
* TODO: User profile
* TODO: Posts
* TODO: Post by user
* TODO: Highlight js code syntax highlight for rich tex editor code type
* TODO: Rich text editor for post
* TODO: Post image and user profile picture

## Content
* Go 1.14.1
* Run development server: **go run main.go** and visit to 127.0.0.1:2000 on the browser.
